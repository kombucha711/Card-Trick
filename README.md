# Card-Trick
Card trick that requires two people to perform on an unsuspecting person.  My processing program sets trick up (person 1 role) for you to guess the hidden card(person 2 role).  Good for practicing.
Heres the gist:  Person 1 asks someone, person 3, to draw 5 cards random or systematically.  They hand person 1 five cards.  Person 1 reviews cards and quickley determines what card person 2 is going to guess.  That card is face down.  The remaining four cards are put down in such a way that person 2 will ALWAYS be able to guess hidden card.  If done correctly, the trick will seem flawless and magical to the unsuspecting person 3.  The role of person 2 (or the guesser) has a much easier time that person 1.  Person 1 has to set up the trick in one go.  The faster this is done, the more real it seems.
